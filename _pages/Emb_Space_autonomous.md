The autonomous laboratory is open for your exploration. Using the basic codes provided in the guided laboratory, students can modify it to run different experiments. Among the options you have are:

- Exploring word embedding regularities. What pattern do regularities have? Is there are common pattern?
- Use word embeddings for a NLP task, by using them as input of a neural network (e.g., document classification, clustering, etc.).
- Train word or document embeddings from scratch, for the original task or for a different one (e.g., machine translation, document classification). This is challenging, as no example has been given of training word embeddings, but it will be graded accordingly. It also requires heavy use of computational resources (Minotauro is a must).
